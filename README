# Mastermind solver

This is a solver for generalized Mastermind, based on a problem
circulating on the web at
<https://interestingengineering.com/solve-the-open-the-lock-puzzle-that-has-internet-puzzled>.
My friends were more interested in which rules were inessential, and
which were shadowed by which others particularly.  It turns out---says
the code in `revised.pl`---that if you have rules 0,1,2, you don't
need any of 3,4,5.
